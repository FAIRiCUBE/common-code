# from vector (poly, line & points) to raster files

The folder contains a notebook which has a collection of scripts for converting vector files to raster files

The goal is to have a common set of tools to convert vector data to raster. This includes point, line as well as polygon vector data sets. 


  
The following diagram shows an overview of the various process stages:
