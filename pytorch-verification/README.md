# PyTorch Verification

This folder contains code to verify correct installation of PyTorch (in a Python environment) and the access to devices it has for machine learning. I.e. only CPU or GPU's (e.g. via CUDA drivers).

After installing pytorch (and Jupyter), open the verification notebook and run the code in it to verify the installation.

### REQUIREMENTS:

A hardware compatible PyTorch installation, see https://pytorch.org for choices and instructions. 

The latest **stable** version for the Python language and the matching compute platform is recommended. At a minimum install both **torch** and **torchvision**. 

A Jupyter installation is also needed to run the Python notebook(s).
